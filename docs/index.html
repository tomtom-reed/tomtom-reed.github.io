      <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Thomas Reed is a highly experienced software developer with a strong background in .NET, Java, and full-stack development. His expertise in backend development is underlaid by a keen focus on security and reliability, including test coverage and process automation, which has made him a valuable member in Fintech companies such as Allocate Inc., Visa (via TrialPay), and E*TRADE. He has also played a pivotal role in modernizing legacy systems, improving developer workflows, and implementing best practices for database and API management. Recently he has discovered a strong interest in expanding those modernization and automation desires into other spaces using AI after playing a major part in implementing OpenAI at Allocate.</p>

<p>With a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Santa Clara University and a BA in Economics from UC Davis, Thomas combines technical ability with a strategic mindset. His leadership in projects such schema-as-code adoption, architecture redesigns, and <strong><a href="/blog/">AI Evangelism</a></strong> showcases his ability to drive technical transformation. Passionate about DevOps, AI, and scalable software solutions, he continuously explores innovative technologies and is a valuable asset in any development team.</p>
